|A connect app establishes a connection between two independent services using an API to interchange data. A typical example of a connect app is a Payroll solution such as Ceridian or ADP. In both cases, all work related to Payroll is done inside Ceridian or the ADP system, and only as a last step is the financial data posted into Dynamics 365 for Financials by means of using the API. A Connect App is mainly created using common development tools, REST API’s, and the API’s made available in Dynamics 365 for Financials from Update 7 and onwards. A Connect App can have a single page or two created as an extension used for setup, configuration or to support for example an import scenario.| An extension can either add to the existing Dynamics 365 for Financials functionality to integrate a solution such as PayPal, or embed an end-to-end experience such as a solution for the dental industry or law firms. An extension typically makes use of the variety of development tools and can also include the APIs available for Dynamics 365 for Financials.
