# Using the Dynamics NAV In-Client Designer
With the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] in-client designer, you can create extensions using drag-and-drop inside the client. With this preview of the in-client designer, you can:

- Enter and exit design mode
- Move fields around
- Preview your design (desktop, tablet, and phone preview)
- Add existing fields
- Add new fields (for limited types)
- Save the extension for the tenant
 
The in-client designer is switched on by choosing the design icon in the ribbon top right corner from any page that you want to make modifications to. In design mode you modify the current page.
        
    **Note**: With this preview you can only add existing and new fields. Adding pages and actions is not yet supported.

On the pane to the right you can see all of the table fields that are available for the specific page. The table fields displayed are based on the underlying table or tables. The field can have a status of **Placed**, which means that the field already exists on the page. A status of **Ready** means that the field doesn't already exist on the page, and that you can place it.

If you want to add a field, use the plus sign and a wizard will guide you through that process. The field is now available and has a status of **Ready**.

    **Note:** When you have finished the wizard, you have to search to find the new field. 

The display type icons let you preview the changes you made to the page on the desktop, tablet, and phone clients so that you can make sure that your design will work on the intended display target(s). 

With this preview of the in-client designer, you can:

- Enter and exit design mode
- Move fields around
- Preview design on device (Phone, Tablet previewer)
- Add existing fields (those that exist in the source table)
- Add new fields (for limited types)
- Save as “MyExtension” which is tenant wide in scope
