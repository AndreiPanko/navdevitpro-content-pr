# Getting Started
To get started writing extensions in code for the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] you will need a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] tenant, and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a cross platform editor that you will use for coding and debugging. And from the Microsoft Azure Gallery, you will download a VM with an environment set up for trying out the preview of the new development environment.

## To do

1) Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
2) Get your developer tenant for [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] in the [Microsoft Azure Gallery]().
