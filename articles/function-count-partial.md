# COUNT Function (Record)
Counts the number of records in a table.
<!-- This topic represents changes to the topic for COUNT that is pending migration from CAPS -->
## Remarks
<!-- Change 1: SE bug 171777 for the CRM SDK returning a maximum of 5000 records -->

**IMPORTANT**:  If you use the COUNT function to return the number of records in a CRM integration table, a maximum count of 5000 is returned. The software development kit for Dynamics CRM does not include support for counting large entity collections. As a result, if a CRM integration table contains thousands of records, COUNT returns a maximum count of 5000.
