# Pages Overview

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], pages are the main way to display and organize data. Pages are the primary object that a user will interact with and have a different behavior based on the type of page that you choose. Pages are designed independently of the device they are to be rendered on, and in this way the same page can be reused across phone, tablet, and web clients.

A page is defined in code as an object composed of controls, properties, actions, and triggers. You can also use the in-client designer in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] to create a page. For more information, see <>.

Whether you're creating a new page, or extending en existing page, you will add a new .al file to your project and describe the page object in code. The difference is basically that for a new page, you need to define the entire page, whereas when modifying an existing page, you only add the extra functionality or modify the existing. 

The structure of a page is hierarchical and breaks down in to three sections. The first block contains metadata for the overall page. The metadata describes the page type and the source table it is showing data from. The next section; the layout, describes the visual parts on the page. The final section details the actions that are published on the page.

|Group|Group<br /><br /> Repeater<br /><br /> CueGroup<br /><br /> FixedLayout|  
|Field|No SubType available for this Type|  
|Part|No SubType available for this Type|

Furthermore, the page has properties. Properties work in the same way for pages as they do for other [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] objects. For more information, see [Page Properties](Page-Properties.md).

## Types of Pages  
The page type you choose depends on the application task that you want to support, the content that you want to display, and how you want to display it. The Role Center page is the main or home page and it helps the user focus on the most important daily tasks and activities. Other types of pages, such as list pages or card pages are typically linked from the home page for easy access. The following page types are available:  
  
-   Card  
  
-   List  
  
-   Role Center  
  
-   Card Part  
  
-   List Part  
  
-   Document  
  
-   Worksheet  
  
-   Confirmation Dialog  
  
-   List Plus  
  
-   Navigate Page (Wizard)  
  
-   Standard Dialog  
  
For more information about page types, see [Touring the RoleTailored Client Pages](Touring-the-RoleTailored-Client-Pages.md).  
  
## Page Controls  

You can add the following page controls to a page depending on the page type you have chosen:  
  
-   FactBox  
  
-   FastTab  
  
-   Cue  
  
-   HomePart  
  
-   ChartPart  
  
-   PagePart  
  
-   SystemPart  
  
-   Ribbon  
  
-   Filter Pane  
  
For more information about controls, see [Touring the RoleTailored Client Pages](Touring-the-RoleTailored-Client-Pages.md).  
  
## Adding Navigation to Pages  
All pages contain menu items and navigation controls called Actions.  
  
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] there are three categories of Actions:  
  
-   Action Items  
  
-   Related Information  
  
-   Reports  
  
 Role Center pages have their own navigation pane and the following actions:  
  
-   Activity Buttons  
  
-   Home Items  
  
For more information about actions, see [Actions Overview](Actions-Overview.md).  
  
## Best Practices for Designing Pages  
We recommend that you simplify the user experience by reducing what users see by default. You can promote the information that the users most frequently need to see and hide the less important information. For example:  
  
-   Place common tasks in the ribbon  
  
-   Organize information pages under FastTabs and, by default, hide the FastTabs that are infrequently visited.  
  
-   Use one to three FactBoxes on a page to provide supplementary information and a place for adding notes.
