# File Handling
The walkthroughs in this section provide step\-by\-step instructions for handling files in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)].  
  
## Best Practices  
 The following are recommended best practices for working with files:  
  
-   Use fully qualified paths to eliminate ambiguity.  
  
-   Be aware of operating system file access restrictions when designing applications that use files. Consider which users have access to files and directories and what access control list \(ACL\) that you need to apply to file directories.
