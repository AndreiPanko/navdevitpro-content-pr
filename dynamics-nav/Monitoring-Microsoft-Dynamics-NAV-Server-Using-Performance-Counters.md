# Monitoring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Using Performance Counters
Performance counters provide information about how well [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is operating. By using monitoring tools such as Windows Performance Monitor and System Center Operations Manager, you can use the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] performance counters to collect data on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances, and then use the data to identify conditions that are affecting performance and make adjustments.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] also provides a Data Collector Set template that you can use to easily create Data Collector Sets that contain all the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] performance counters.
