# How to: Install and Configure Internet Information Services for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client
This topic describes how to install and configure Internet Information Service \(IIS\) for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. To deploy the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] on a computer that running IIS 7.0 or IIS 8.0. A website for [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] is installed on the IIS.  
  
 IIS must have the following features enabled:  
  
-   .NET Extensibility \(on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008\), .NET Extensibility 4.5 \(on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012\), .NET Extensibility 4.6 \(on Windows 10\)  
  
-   ASP.NET \(on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008\), ASP.NET 4.5 \(on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012\), or ASP.NET 4.6 \(on Windows 10\)  
  
-   ISAPI Extensions  
  
-   ISAPI Filters  
  
-   Request Filtering  
  
-   Windows Authentication  
  
-   Static Content  
  
-   HTTP Activation  
  
 The procedure is slightly different for the different versions of Windows. For more information, see the following sections:

> [!NOTE]  
>  Instead of manually installing IIS, you can use the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup wizard to install and enable the IIS features. For more information, see [Using Microsoft Dynamics NAV Setup to Install IIS Features](Using-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Setup-to-Install-IIS-Features.md).  
  
##  <a name="Win7"></a> Installing IIS Features on Windows 7
