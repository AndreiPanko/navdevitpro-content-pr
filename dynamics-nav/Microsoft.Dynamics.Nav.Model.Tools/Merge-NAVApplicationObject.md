# Merge-NAVApplicationObject

## SYNOPSIS
Compares the changes that have been made to application objects between two versions of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and applies the difference to a third set of application objects.
The result of the merge is a number of text files with the merged application objects.
Any conflicts that the cmdlet cannot merge are identified in conflict files.

## SYNTAX

```
Merge-NAVApplicationObject [-OriginalPath] <String[]> [-ModifiedPath] <String[]> [-TargetPath] <String[]>
 [-ResultPath] <String> [-PassThru] [-Legacy] [-DateTimeProperty <DateTimePropertyAction>]
 [-ModifiedProperty <ModifiedPropertyAction>] [-VersionListProperty <VersionListPropertyAction>]
 [-DocumentationConflict <DocumentationConflictAction>] [-Strict] [-Force] [-DisableCommentOut] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Use the Merge-NAVApplicationObject cmdlet to calculate the changes that have been made to application objects between two versions of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and to apply the difference to a third set of application objects.
You specify an original version and compare that to a latest version.
The difference is then applied to the target version.
The result of the merge is a number of text files with the merged application objects.
Any conflicts that the cmdlet cannot merge are identified in conflict files.

For example, you can use the cmdlet to apply changes from an update to your version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
The following list provides examples of the parameter values that you can specify when you merge versions of Microsoft Dynamics NAV:

OriginalPath - Objects from the Microsoft release of Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

ModifiedPath - Objects from your solution based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV, such as MySolution.

TargetPath - Objects from the updated version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, such as Cumulative Update 1.

ResultPath - Text files with the result of the merge, such as MySolution upgraded to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Cumulative Update 1.

The Merge-NAVApplicationObject cmdlet compares OriginalPath to ModifiedPath, applies as many changes as possible to TargetPath, and the resulting text files are stored in the folder that is specified by the ResultPath parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Merge-NAVApplicationObject -OriginalPath C:\Microsoft\NAV2017\DE\RTM\*.TXT -TargetPath C:\Microsoft\NAV2017\DE\CU1\*.TXT -ModifiedPath C:\Solution\NAV2017\DE\RTM\*.TXT -ResultPath C:\Solution\NAV2017\DE\CU1\
          Processed 14 objects:
          Inserted   0 objects
          Deleted    0 objects
          Merged     3 objects
          Identical  9 objects
          Conflict   2 objects
          Failed     0 objects
          Processed 5 changes:
          Conflict   1 changes
          % Merged   80,00
```


This example compares the application objects from the German version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 to a customized solution that modified that version.
The result of the comparison is applied to the German version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Cumulative Update 1.
The final result is stored in the folder that is specified in the -ResultPath parameter.
When the merge completes, the summary of the result is shown.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Merge-NAVApplicationObject -OriginalPath C:\Solution\ORIGINAL\COD1-RTM.TXT -ModifiedPath C:\Solution\MODIFIED\My-COD1-RTM.txt -TargetPath C:\Solution\TARGET\COD1-CU1.TXT -ResultPath C:\Solution\RESULT\My-COD1-CU1.TXT - -PassThru
```

This example compares a text file with codeunit 1 from the original release of Microsoft Dynamics NAV to a modified version of codeunit 1.
The result of the comparison is applied to a version of codeunit 1 from Cumulative Update 1.
The final result is stored in the file that is specified in the -ResultPath parameter.
When the merge completes, the summary of the result is shown.

This example compares the documentation triggers in two versions of a page object and applies the result of the comparison to a third version.
The final result is stored in the file that is specified in the -ResultPath parameter.
This is then repeated.
In the first command, the -DocumentationConflict parameter is set to Strict so that conflicting documentation is captured as conflicts.
In the second command, the conflicting entries are both inserted into the resulting file with the content from MODIFIED listed first.
When the merge completes, a summary of the merge is shown.
