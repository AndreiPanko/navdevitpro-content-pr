# Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2016
This section describes how to upgrade from [!INCLUDE[nav7long](includes/nav7long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[navsicily](includes/navsicily_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[navcrete](includes/navcrete_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)]. If you have an earlier version, such as [!INCLUDE[nav2009sp1](includes/nav2009sp1_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav2009r2](includes/nav2009r2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_5](includes/nav_5_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[nav_4](includes/nav_4_md.md)], you must first upgrade that version to [!INCLUDE[nav7long](includes/nav7long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510382) in the MSDN Library.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can also upgrade from [!INCLUDE[nav2009sp1](includes/nav2009sp1_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav2009r2](includes/nav2009r2_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[navcrete](includes/navcrete_md.md)] as described on the [Dynamics NAV Team Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/nav/2014/11/09/cumulative-update-1-for-microsoft-dynamics-nav-2015-has-been-released/). Then you can use the automated upgrade process to upgrade to [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)].  
  
 To upgrade to [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you must complete the following main steps:  
  
-   Convert the database.  
  
-   Upgrade the code.  
  
-   Upgrade the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you upgrade from [!INCLUDE[nav2009r2](includes/nav2009r2_md.md)] or earlier to [!INCLUDE[nav7long](includes/nav7long_md.md)] or later, the link between interaction records and logged email messages is lost. To resolve this issue, the administrator has to log all mails again to restore the links. For more information, see [Logging Interaction Links are Lost When You Upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 R2](../Topic/Troubleshooting:%20Email%20Logging.md#LoggingInteractionLinks).
