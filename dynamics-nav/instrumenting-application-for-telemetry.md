# Instrumenting an Application for Telemetry

However, none of this really tells you about usersâ€™ specific activity within the app itself. Such activity cannot be generalized or collected automatically. Collecting that data is the purpose of instrumenting your app from the inside for telemetry and analytics.

Logging is typically oriented around the internal structure of your app rather than reflecting real-world customer usage. In short, logging is how you collect data about your app in the lab; instrumenting your app for telemetry, on the other hand, is how you collect data once the app is released into the wild.

Telemetry is an automated remote measurement and data collection.
