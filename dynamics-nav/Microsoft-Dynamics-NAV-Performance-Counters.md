# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Performance Counters
The following table describes the performance counters that are available in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] for monitoring [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances.  

|Category|Counter|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Client, NAS, and Web Service sessions|\# Active sessions|Number of active sessions on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> An active session is a connection to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance from a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client, such as the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], NAS, or Web services.|  
||Server operations/sec|Number of operations that have started on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] per second.<br /><br /> An operation is a call to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance from a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client to run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects. **Note:**  OData and SOAP requests are not included.|  
||Average server operation time \(ms\)|Average duration of server operations in milliseconds.|  
|SQL Server connections|\# Mounted tenants|Number of tenants that are mounted on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> For more information about tenants, see [Multitenant Deployment Architecture](Multitenant-Deployment-Architecture.md).|  
||\# Open connections|Count of the current number of open connections from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance to [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] databases on SQL Servers.|  
||% Query repositioning rate|Percentage of queries that are re-executed when fetching the query result.|  
||Heartbeat time \(ms\)|The time that it takes to complete a single write to a system table. Every 30 seconds, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance writes a record to indicate that the instance is "alive."<br /><br /> You can use this counter to indicate if there is network latency between the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the SQL Server.|  
||\# Preferred connection total requests|Count of the total number of requests to the preferred connection cache. The preferred connection cache contains requests from the SQL connection pool that was last used by a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user.|  
||% Preferred connection cache hit rate|Percentage of hits in the preferred connection cache, compared to the total number of requests.|  
|Data and caching|\# Calculated fields cache total requests|Count of the total number of requests to the calculated fields cache. The calculated fields cache contains the results of [CALCFIELDS Function \(Record\)](CALCFIELDS-Function--Record-.md) calls.|  
||% Calculated fields cache hit rate|Percentage of hits in the calculated fields cache, compared to the total requests to the calculated fields cache.|  
||\# Command cache total requests|Count of the total number of requests to the command cache. The command cache contains the results of all SQL commands.|  
||% Command cache hit rate|Percentage of hits in the command cache, compared to the total requests to the command cache.|  
||\# Primary key cache total requests|Count of the total number of requests to the primary key cache. The primary key cache contains the results of requests to get a record by using its primary key.|  
||% Primary key cache hit rate|Percentage of hits in the primary key cache, compared to the total requests to the primary key cache.|  
||\# Result set cache total requests|Count of the total number of requests to the result set cache. The result set cache contains result sets that are returned from SQL Server.|  
||% Result set cache hit rate|Percentage of hits in the result set cache, compared to the total requests to the result set cache.|  
||\# Rows in all temporary tables|Count of number of rows in all temporary tables.|
