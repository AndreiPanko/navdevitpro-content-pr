# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows PowerShell Cmdlets
[!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] includes [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] cmdlets for administration and for development and file management of application object files and extension packages. The cmdlets are available in two Windows PowerShell modules: [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)].  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] includes cmdlets for administering the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] deployment, such as adding and configuring [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] server instances, databases, and users. Also included are cmdlets for administering extension packages. The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] is installed with the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] includes cmdlets for merging and modifying application object files. Also included are cmdlets for creating extension packages. The [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] is installed with the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)].  
  
 The cmdlets are implemented in [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] 3.0, which is included with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 and later. For other versions of Windows supported for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you can install it as part of the [Windows Management Framework 3.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=293806) on the Microsoft Download Center.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Alternatively to running [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] from where they are installed, you can import the relevant module into the [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] Integrated Scripting Environment \(ISE\).  
  
## Starting a [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] Session

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To run the cmdlets in the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)], you must be a member of the local Administrator group on the computer where the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] is installed.
