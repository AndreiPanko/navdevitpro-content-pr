2. Expand the **OData Services** tab, and select the **Enable OData Services** checkbox first, then select the **Enable API Services** checkbox.
3. Check that the values for the **OData Base URL** and **Port** are entered correctly.
4. ??
5. In [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], search for **API Setup** and then choose the related link.
6. On the **API Setup** page, choose the **Integrate APIs** button.  
    > [!NOTE] 
    > This will start a process of populating all the integration tables with records for all APIs. The process can take several minutes.
