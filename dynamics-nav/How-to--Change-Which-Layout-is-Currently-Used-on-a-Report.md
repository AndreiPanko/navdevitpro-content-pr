# How to: Change Which Layout is Currently Used on a Report
This procedure describes how to change the layout that is used by a report. A report can be set up with more than one report layout, which you can then switch among as needed.  
  
 Depending on the layouts that are available for a report, you can choose to use a built\-in RDLC report layout, a built\-in Word report layout, or a custom layout. For more information about RDLC and Word report layouts, built\-in and custom layouts, and more, see [About Report Layouts](../Topic/About%20Report%20Layouts.md).  
  
### To change the layout that is used on a report  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_9652 Report Layout Selection $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     The **\($ N\_9652 Report Layout Selection $\)** window lists all the reports that are available for the company that is specified in the **Company** field at the top of the window.  
  
     The **\($ N\_9652\_2 Selected Layout $\)** field specifies the layout that is currently used on the report.  
  
2.  Set the **Company** field at the top of the window to the company that includes the report.  
  
3.  To change the layout that is used by a report, in the row for the report in the list, set the **\($ N\_9652\_2 Selected Layout $\)** field to one of the following options:  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tableoption](../dynamics-nav/includes/bp_tableoption_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../dynamics-nav/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**RDLC \(built\-in\)**|Uses the built\-in RDLC report layout on the report.|  
    |**Word \(built\-in\)**|Uses the built\-in Word report layout on the report.|  
    |**Custom**|Uses a custom layout on the report.<br /><br /> You can see which custom layouts are available for the report in the **\($ N\_9653 Custom Layouts $\)** FactBox. If there are no custom layouts for the report, then you will have to create one first.<br /><br /> If you choose this option, go to the next procedure to specify the custom layout that you want to use.|  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you choose **RDLC \(built\-in\)** or **Word \(built\-in\)** and you get an error message that the report does not have a layout of the specified type, then you must choose another layout option or create a custom report layout of the type that you want to use.  
  
 If you selected a built\-in RDLC or Word report layout, then no further action is required and the layout will be used the next time the report is run.  
  
### To specify a custom layout on a report  
  
1.  You specify which custom layout to use on the report from the **\($ N\_9650 Report Layouts $\)** window. If the **\($ N\_9650 Report Layouts $\)** window is not open, then in the **Report Layout Description** field, choose the lookup button.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_9650 Report Layouts $\)** window, select the row for custom layout that you want to use, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 You return to the **\($ N\_9652 Report Layout Selection $\)** window. The name of the selected custom layout displays in the **\($ N\_9652\_5 Report Description $\)** field. The custom layout will be used the next time that you run the report.
