# Automated Data Capture System
The Automated Data Capture System \(ADCS\) is a [!INCLUDE[navnow](../dynamics-nav/includes/navnow_md.md)] tool that lets you accurately capture data for inbound, outbound, and internal documents, primarily for warehouse activities. With ADCS, company employees use handheld devices and radio frequency technology to continuously validate warehouse inventories.  
  
## Installing ADCS  
 To install ADCS, you must customize the list of installation components to include ADCS, which is not included in one of the predefined [Installation Options](../dynamics-nav/Installation-Options.md). For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](../Topic/How%20to:%20Choose%20Components%20to%20Install.md).  
  
 For more information about configuring ADCS, see [Configuring Automated Data Capture System](../dynamics-nav/Configuring-Automated-Data-Capture-System.md).
