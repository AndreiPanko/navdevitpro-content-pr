# Web Services
The following sections provide an overview of the documentation for web services in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](../dynamics-nav/includes/navnowlong_md.md)].  
  
## Overview of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../dynamics-nav/includes/navnow_md.md)] Web Services  
 This section provides overview material and information that is relevant to both SOAP and OData web services.
