# Getting Started
To get started writing extensions in code for the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] you will need a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] tenant, and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a cross platform editor that you will use for coding and debugging. For the preview, you will download a VM from the Microsoft Azure Gallery which is set up for trying out the new development environment.

## Steps
1) First, you will need an Azure subscription. Sign up for a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).   
2) Go to [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryFeaturedMenuItemBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) and search for the **Microsoft Dynamics Developer Preview**.  
3) Follow the instructions on the screen to deploy and run.
