**MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS**

**MICROSOFT DYNAMICS NAV 2017**

These license terms (“agreement”) are an agreement between you and
Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates).

This agreement applies to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or
updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those
different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s
rights relating to pre-updated software or services). **This agreement
supersedes the license terms embedded in the software.**

**By installing, having installed, subscribing to, or using the
software, you accept this agreement** (including any modifications made
to it from time to time)**. If you do not accept this agreement, do not
install, have installed, subscribe to, or use the software. **

If an individual enters into this agreement on behalf of a legal entity,
that individual represents that he or she has the authority to bind that
entity to this agreement.

***Notice Regarding Subscription Validation*. Servers on which the
software is installed may periodically provide information to verify
that the software is properly licensed and that the term has not
expired. This information includes the customer subscription identifier,
product name, license serial number, product version number, and date of
last use. Individual customer data will be stored for up to 270 days in
the United States. Aggregated data may be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of our validation features, will also be stored in the
United States and may be retained indefinitely. By using the software,
you consent to the transmission of the information described in this
paragraph.**

**If you comply with this agreement, you have the rights below for each
license you acquire for the software.**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **e.** **Font Components.** While the software is running, you may use
> its fonts to display and print content. You may temporarily download
> the fonts to a printer or other output device to print content, and
> you may embed fonts in content only as permitted by the embedding
> restrictions in the fonts.

4. TYPES OF USER LICENSES. Except as otherwise specified, the types of user licenses for the software are as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### a. Access Licenses (CALs and SALs). In addition to the server software license, you must acquire and assign an Access License to each user that accesses the ERP solution directly or indirectly. You need an Access License for each user that directly or indirectly accesses the ERP solution through a third party application. Access Licenses are specific to an ERP solution and may not be used with or shared among different ERP solutions.

> **Types of CALs.** There are two types of CALs: Full CALs and Limited
> CALs.

-   A “**Full CAL**” is a license that entitles a user to perform the
    tasks of a Full User.

<!-- -->

-   ### A “Limited CAL” is a license that entitles a user to perform only the tasks of a Limited User. You may license up to 4 Limited CALs per Full CAL. 

> **Types of SALs.** There are three types of SALs: Standard SALs,
> Extended Use Additive SALs, and Limited SALs.

-   A “**Standard SAL**” is a base SAL license that entitles a user to
    perform Full User tasks across the ERP Solution using all of the
    functionality included in the Starter Pack, as described in the
    Microsoft Dynamics NAV Licensing Guide located at
    [https://aka.ms/NAV2017LicensingGuide](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FNAV2017LicensingGuide&data=01%7C01%7Caleahy%40microsoft.com%7Cc5edef34849e4afad84508d3ec7450da%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1&sdata=HYw3U8JLTGPxeqj0KmcMW98JHrMzr2Mk7orkONsmw1w%3D&reserved=0).

-   An **“Extended Use Additive SAL”** is a license, additive to the
    Standard SAL, which entitles a user to perform Full User tasks using
    the functionality included in the Extended Pack, as described in the
    Microsoft Dynamics NAV Licensing Guide.

<!-- -->

-   ### A “Limited SAL” is a license that entitles a user to perform only the tasks of a Limited User. 

> **b. “Concurrent CALs”** are licenses that allow any user to access
> the ERP solution. The number of concurrent CALs licensed refers to the
> maximum number of users that may access the ERP solution
> simultaneously. You may select the Full CAL or Limited CAL as
> concurrent CAL types. Concurrent CALs can only be licensed under the
> Perpetual License Model.

### c. “User SALs” are licenses that are specific to each user and may not be shared with other users. You may select the Standard SAL, the Extended Use Additive SAL, or the Limited SAL as user SAL types. If you select the Extended Use Additive SAL, You must license Extended Use Additive SALs for all Standard SALs. The Limited SAL grants access to the same set of functionalities that are available to users performing Full User tasks, subject to the restrictions listed in the Limited User definition. Microsoft grants you, at no charge, two SALs of the same type used by your Full Users: one specifically for an External Accountant User, and one specifically for a System Administrator User. You may permanently reassign your user SAL from one user to another. You may temporarily reassign your user SAL to a temporary user while the permanent user is absent. The External Accountant User and the System Administrator User cannot be used for any other purposes. User SALs can only be licensed under the Subscription License Model.

> **d. “External Users”** You do not need Access Licenses for external
> users. External users must be designated in the user table for the
> software, and cannot use any clients provided by the Microsoft
> Dynamics NAV Application Programming Interface (API), such as the
> Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Windows client, or the Microsoft Dynamics
> NAV 2017 Web Client. External User licenses must not be used for
> business process outsourcing purposes.
>
> For additional information about the types of user licenses and the
> license restrictions regarding user licenses, see the Microsoft
> Dynamics NAV Licensing Guide located at
> [https://aka.ms/NAV2017LicensingGuide](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FNAV2017LicensingGuide&data=01%7C01%7Caleahy%40microsoft.com%7Cc5edef34849e4afad84508d3ec7450da%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1&sdata=HYw3U8JLTGPxeqj0KmcMW98JHrMzr2Mk7orkONsmw1w%3D&reserved=0).

**5. TERMS SPECIFIC TO SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE MODEL.**

a.  **Subscription Validation.**

    -   Servers on which the software is installed will from time to
        > time perform a validation check of the software. Validation
        > verifies that the software has been properly licensed. It also
        > verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the
        > validation functions of the software.

    -   The validation check may be initiated by the software
        or Microsoft. To enable validation checks, the software may from
        time to time require updates or additional downloads of the
        validation functions of the software. The updates or downloads
        are required for the proper functioning of the software and may
        be downloaded and installed without further notice to you.
        During or after a validation check, the server may send
        information about the software, the computer and the results of
        the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes
        customer subscription identifier, product name, license serial
        number, product version number, and the date of last use.
        Microsoft will use this information only to verify
        licensing compliance. By using the software, you consent to the
        transmission of this information. For more information about
        validation and what is sent during or after a validation check,
        see <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=829950>.

    -   If, after a validation check, the software is found to be
        > improperly licensed, Microsoft or your partner may provide
        > notice that the software is improperly licensed, and you may

        -   receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the
            > software, or

        -   need to follow instructions in the notice to be licensed to
            > use the software.

b.  **Term.** The term for your subscription license is set in your
    > agreement with your partner.

If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

**23. DEFENSE OF INFRINGEMENT AND MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIMS.** Microsoft
will defend you against any claims made by an unaffiliated third party
that the software infringes its patent, copyright or trademark or
misappropriates its trade secret, and will pay the amount of any
resulting adverse final judgment (or settlement to which Microsoft
consents).

> You must notify us promptly in writing of the claim and give us sole
> control over its defense or settlement. You agree to provide us with
> reasonable assistance in defending the claim, and Microsoft will
> reimburse you for reasonable out of pocket expenses that you incur in
> providing that assistance. The terms “misappropriation” and “trade
> secret” are used as defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, except
> in the case of claims arising outside the United States, in which case
> “trade secret” will mean “undisclosed information” as described in
> Article 39.2 of the TRIPs agreement and “misappropriation” will mean
> intentionally unlawful use.
>
> Our obligations will not apply to the extent that the claim or adverse
> final judgment is based on (i) your use of the software after
> Microsoft notifies you to discontinue use due to such a claim; (ii)
> your combining the software with a non-Microsoft product (hardware,
> software or service), data or business process including third party
> add-ons or programs; (iii) damages attributable to the value of the
> use of a non-Microsoft product, data or business process; (iv) your
> altering or modifying the software, including any modifications by
> third parties; (v) your distribution of the software to, or its use
> for the benefit of, any third party; (vi) your use of Microsoft
> trademark(s) without express written consent to do so; or (vii) for
> any trade secret claim, your acquiring a trade secret (a) through
> improper means; (b) under circumstances giving rise to a duty to
> maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or (c) from a person (other
> than Microsoft or its affiliates) who owed to the party asserting the
> claim a duty to maintain the secrecy or limit the use of the trade
> secret. You will reimburse us for any costs or damages that result
> from these actions.
>
> If Microsoft receives information concerning an infringement or
> misappropriation claim related to the software, Microsoft may, at its
> expense and without obligation to do so, either (i) procure for you
> the right to continue to run the software, or (ii) modify the software
> or replace it with a functional equivalent, to make it non-infringing,
> in which case you will stop running the software immediately. If, as a
> result of an infringement or misappropriation claim, your use of the
> software is enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Microsoft
> will, at its option, either procure the right to continue its use,
> replace it with a functional equivalent, modify it to make it
> non-infringing, or refund the amount paid and terminate this license.
>
> If any other type of third party claim is brought against you
> regarding Microsoft’s intellectual property, you must notify us
> promptly in writing. Microsoft may, at its option, choose to treat
> these claims as being covered by this section. This Section 23
> provides your exclusive remedy for third party copyright, patent or
> trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims.

**24. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.** **You can recover from
Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to the amount you
paid for the software except for claims covered by Section 23. You
cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits,
special, indirect or incidental damages.**

> This limitation applies to
>
> • anything related to the: (i) software, (ii) services, (iii) content
> (including code) on any third party Internet sites, or (iv) third
> party materials; and
>
> • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
> condition, strict liability, negligence, loss of data, damage to
> records or data, loss of goodwill, loss as a consequence of a business
> interruption or any other tort to the extent permitted by applicable
> law.
>
> It also applies even if
>
> • repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully
> compensate you for any losses; or
>
> • Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the
> damages.
>
> Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
> consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
> apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may
> not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or
> other damages.

25. VERIFYING COMPLIANCE.
=========================

> **a.** **Right to verify compliance.**  You are required to keep
> records (including proof of purchase) relating to the software you use
> under this agreement.  Microsoft has the right to verify compliance
> with this agreement, at Microsoft’s expense. You agree to provide
> reasonable cooperation in the event of a compliance audit, including
> by allowing Microsoft, on request, to access the usage report as a
> tool in conducting the audit.
>
> **b.** **Verification process and limitations.**  To verify compliance
> with the terms of this Agreement, Microsoft will engage an independent
> accountant from an internationally recognized public accounting firm,
> which will be subject to a confidentiality obligation.  Verification
> will take place upon not fewer than 30 days’ notice, during normal
> business hours and in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably
> with your operations.  As an alternative, Microsoft can require you to
> complete Microsoft’s self-audit questionnaire relating to the software
> you use under this agreement, but reserves the right to use a
> verification process as set out above. 

c. Verification frequency. If Microsoft undertakes verification and does not find material unlicensed use (license shortage of 5% or more), then Microsoft will not undertake another verification of the same entity for at least one year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

d. Use of Results. Microsoft and Microsoft’s auditors will use the information obtained in compliance verification only to enforce Microsoft’s rights and to determine whether you are in compliance with the terms of this agreement.  By invoking the rights and procedures described above, Microsoft does not waive its rights to enforce this agreement or to protect its intellectual property by any other means permitted by law. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

e. Remedies for non-compliance.  If verification or self-audit reveals any unlicensed use, you must promptly order sufficient licenses to cover your use. If material unlicensed use is found, you must reimburse Microsoft for the costs Microsoft has incurred in verification and acquire the necessary additional licenses at single retail license cost within 30 days.

LIMITED WARRANTY

A.  **LIMITED WARRANTY.** If you follow the instructions, the software
    will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials
    that you receive in or with the software.

References to “limited warranty” are references to the express warranty
provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to other
rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights and
remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees under local
Consumer Law.

A.  **TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES. The limited warranty covers the software for one
    year after acquired by the first user. If you receive supplements,
    updates, or replacement software during that year, they will be
    covered for the remainder of the warranty or 30 days, whichever
    is longer.** If the first user transfers the software, the remainder
    of the warranty will apply to the recipient.

**To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties, guarantees or
conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty.** Some
states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts,
so these limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to
you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an
implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.

A.  **EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY.** This warranty does not cover problems
    caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or
    events beyond Microsoft’s reasonable control.

B.  **REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. Microsoft will repair or replace
    the software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or replace it,
    Microsoft will refund the amount shown on your receipt for
    the software. It will also repair or replace supplements, updates
    and replacement software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or
    replace them, it will refund the amount you paid for them, if any.
    You must uninstall the software and return any media and other
    associated materials to Microsoft with proof of purchase to obtain
    a refund. These are your only remedies for breach of the
    limited warranty.**

C.  **CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED. You may have additional consumer
    rights under your local laws, which this agreement cannot change.**

D.  **WARRANTY PROCEDURES.** You need proof of purchase for
    warranty service.

    1.  **United States and Canada.** For warranty service or
        information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired
        in the United States and Canada, contact Microsoft at

    1.  **Europe, Middle East and Africa.** If you acquired the software
        in Europe, the Middle East or Africa, Microsoft Ireland
        Operations Limited makes this limited warranty. To make a claim
        under this warranty, you should contact either

-   Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium
    Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate,
    Dublin 18, Ireland; or

        and Australia.** If you acquired the software outside the United
        States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia,
        contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country
        (see www.microsoft.com/worldwide).

A.  **NO OTHER WARRANTIES. The limited warranty is the only direct
    warranty from Microsoft. Microsoft gives no other express
    warranties, guarantees or conditions. Where allowed by your local
    laws, Microsoft excludes implied warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.** If your
    local laws give you any implied warranties, guarantees or
    conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in
    the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent
    permitted by your local laws.

**FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY.** In this paragraph, “goods” refers to the
software for which Microsoft provides the express warranty. Our goods
come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian
Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major
failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or
damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if
the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not
amount to a major failure. Goods presented for repair may be replaced by
refurbished goods of the same type rather than being replaced.
Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.

A.  **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. The
    Limitation on and Exclusion of Damages clause above applies to
    breaches of this limited warranty.**

**This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have
other rights which vary from state to state. You may also have other
rights which vary from country to country.**
