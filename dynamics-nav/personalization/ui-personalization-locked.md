# Why the page is locked
If there is a lock icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page (as shown), this means that you are currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-locked.png "Personalize lock")

This is because, until now, you have only personalized by using [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].

If you want to do some more personalizing to the page now, then you choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch. In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], the page will remain as was before and will not be effected by the new changes. This means that going forward, you personalize the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] separately, so the page will potenially look different there.For more information,see [Working with personalization between the Dynamics NAV Windows and Web client](ui-personalization-overview.md#PersonalizationWinWeb).
