[!INCLUDE[personalization_md](includes/personalization_md.md)]
# Why is the page is locked from personalizing?
If there is a lock icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page (as shown), this means that you are currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].

![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-locked.png "Personalize lock")

There can be two reasons for this:
1.  Until now, you have only used the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

    or
     
2. You have used the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to personalize the page before, but it was done using a [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] or earlier version.   

If you want to do some more personalizing to the page now in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch. In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], the page will remain as was before and will not be effected by the new changes in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. In the future, you will personalize the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] separately. Therefore, the page can potentially look different between the two.
