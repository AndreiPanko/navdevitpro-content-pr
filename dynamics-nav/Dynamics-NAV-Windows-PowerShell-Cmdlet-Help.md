#Dynamics NAV Windows PowerShell Cmdlet Help
The cmdlet help for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/nav2017.md)] is currently not available in the MSDN Libary. However, the cmdlet help in the PowerShell command-line interface is up-to-date with [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)], so you can use that instead. For more information, see [Getting Help on [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Cmdlets](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-PowerShell-Cmdlets.md#GetHelp).

If you want to see the [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] version of the cmdlet help in the MSDN Library, use the following links:
