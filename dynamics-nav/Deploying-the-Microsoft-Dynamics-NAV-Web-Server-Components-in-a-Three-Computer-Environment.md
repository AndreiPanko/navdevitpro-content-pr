 ![NAV Web client installation on three computers](media/NAV_Web_Client_Install_Three_Computers.png "NAV\_Web\_Client\_Install\_Three\_Computers")  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  For a step-by-step example that describes how to deploy this scenario, see [Walkthrough: Installing the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Server Components on Three Computers](Walkthrough:%20Installing%20the%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20NAV%20Web%20Server%20Components%20on%20Three%20Computers.md).  
  
## Deployment Tasks  
 To deploy the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] in this scenario, complete the following tasks.  
  
### Pre-Installation Tasks  
 The following table includes tasks to perform before you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].  
  
|Task|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|For more information, see|  
|----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Make sure that system requirements are met.|Verify that the computer has the required hardware and software installed.|[System Requirements for Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2016](System-Requirements-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-2016.md)|  
|Install Internet Information Services 7.0 or Internet Information Services 8.0.|When you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup creates a website for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] on IIS. If IIS is already installed, then make sure that the required features are enabled. **Note:**  Instead of installing and configuring IIS manually, you can use [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup to install IIS and enable the required features.|[How to: Install and Configure Internet Information Services for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How%20to:%20Install%20and%20Configure%20Internet%20Information%20Services%20for%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20NAV%20Web%20Client.md)|  
|Determine the TCP port for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and allow communication on the port through Windows Firewall.|[!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup creates a website on IIS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. During Setup, you will have to choose the port to use for the site. The default port that is used in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup is port 8080. If you are not sure of which port to use, then use the default port.<br /><br /> If the computer is running Windows 7 or Windows 8 with Windows Firewall enabled, then you have to create an inbound rule that allows communication on the port.|[How to: Create an Inbound Rule in Windows Firewall for the Port of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How%20to:%20Create%20an%20Inbound%20Rule%20in%20Windows%20Firewall%20for%20the%20Port%20of%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20NAV%20Web%20Client.md)|  
|Set up the service account for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the SQL Server database.|Optional. When you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can specify a user account that will be used to log on to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database. The default service account is Network Service. If you want to use Network Service, then no action is required for this task.|[Provisioning the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Account](Provisioning-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Account.md).|  
|Obtain and install an SSL certificate.|Optional. If you want to configure SSL on the connection to [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then complete the following procedures:<br /><br /> -   Obtain an SSL certificate.<br />-   Import the certificate into the local computer store of the computer on which you will install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].<br />-   Obtain the certificate's thumbprint. **Note:**  You can also configure SSL after you have installed the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [Post-installation Tasks](Deploying-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Server-Components-in-a-Three-Computer-Environment.md#PostInstall).|The following sections in the Walkthrough: Configuring Web Services to Use SSL \(SOAP and OData\) topic:<br /><br /> -   [Obtaining an SSL Certificate](Walkthrough:%20Configuring%20Web%20Services%20to%20Use%20SSL%20\(SOAP%20and%20OData\).md#ObtainCert)<br />-   [Importing the SSL Certificate into the Local Computer Store of the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server computer](Walkthrough:%20Configuring%20Web%20Services%20to%20Use%20SSL%20\(SOAP%20and%20OData\).md#Importing)<br />-   [Obtaining the Certificate's Thumbprint](Walkthrough:%20Configuring%20Web%20Services%20to%20Use%20SSL%20\(SOAP%20and%20OData\).md#Thumbprint)|  
  
### Installation Tasks  
 The following table includes tasks for installing the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
|Task|Description|For more information, see|  
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|  
|Install the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database components.|On the computer designated for SQL Server, run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup and choose the **SQL Server Database Components** option.|[How to: Run Setup](How%20to:%20Run%20Setup.md)|  
|Start the SQL Server Browser Service on the SQL Server computer.|This task is only required if you are using a named database instance for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. By default, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] uses the database instance named NAVDEMO. The SQL Server Browser Service is required so that the database instance can be discovered by the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance, which in this scenario, is another computer. To start the SQL Server, use SQL Server Configuration Manager.|[How to: Start SQL Browser Service](How%20to:%20Start%20SQL%20Browser%20Service.md)|  
|Install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].|On the computer designated for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup and choose the **Server** option.|[How to: Run Setup](How%20to:%20Run%20Setup.md)|  
|Install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].|On the web server computer, run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup and choose the **Web Server Components** option.|[How to: Install the Web Server Components](How%20to:%20Install%20the%20Web%20Server%20Components.md)|  
|Configure delegation from the web server to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].|Because [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is running on a different computer than the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], you must configure computer running [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] to delegate its access to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] on behalf of the device trying to access the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].|[How to: Configure Delegation for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How%20to:%20Configure%20Delegation%20for%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20NAV%20Web%20Client.md)|
