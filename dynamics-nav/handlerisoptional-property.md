# HandlerIsOptional Property
Sets whether the notification handler function is optional.  
  
## Applies To  
C/AL test functions that have the [FunctionType](FunctionType-Property--Test-Codeunits-.md) set to **SendNotificationHandler** or **RecallNotificationHandler**.  
  
## Property Value  
**Yes** if handler function is optional; otherwise, **No**. The default value is **No**.

## Remarks  
The **HandlerIsOptional** property determines how a **SendNotificationHandler** or **RecallNotificationHandler** handler behaves when testing notifications that are sent (by a [SEND function](function-notificationsend.md) call) or recalled (by a [Recall function](function-notificationrecall.md) call) in a test function. You are not required to have a notification handler, even if a notification is sent or recalled from the test code. The following table provides an overview of the behavior if you use a notification handler: 

|Test function code|HandlerIsOptional=Yes|HandlerIsOptional=No|
|Sends/recalls a notification|Handler gets called; test succeeds|Handler gets called; test succeeds|
|Does not send/recall a notification|Handler is not called; test succeeds|Handler is not called; test fails.|

This behavior differs from other handler types, like **MessageHandler** and **ConfirmHandler**. With these types, a test will fail if there is no corresponding handler for a UI function call or if there is a handler but no UI function call. 

The **HandlerIsOptional** property gives you more control over how you want to test notifications. For example, if you wanted to test for unwanted notifications, you could set the **HandlerIsOptional** property to **Yes**, then add a **SendNotificationHandler** handler that throws an error explicitly from C/AL code. In this case, if a notification is sent, you will get the error; otherwise, the handler is not called, and the everything is good.
