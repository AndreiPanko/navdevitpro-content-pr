# New-NAVEncryptionKey

## SYNOPSIS
Create an encryption key and stores it in a file in a specified path on the computer or network.

## SYNTAX

```
New-NAVEncryptionKey [-KeyPath] <String> [-Password <SecureString>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
```

## DESCRIPTION
When using SQL Server authentication between the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server instance and database in SQL Server, Microsoft Dynamics NAV encrypts passwords that are used by a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server instance to access to Microsoft Dynamics NAV databases in SQL Server.
This includes, for example, the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server service account credentials and the database credentials.
To encrypt and decrypt the passwords, an encryption key is used.
Microsoft Dynamics NAV uses a single encryption key per server instance.
In some cases, such as when upgrading or migrating a system from one set of hardware to another, you might need to copy of the encryption key to use it on another Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server instance.
By using the New-NAVEncryptionKey cmdlet, you can create an encryption key, and then use the Import-NAVEncryptionKey cmdlet to import the exported key to a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server instance and database.
The New-NAVEncryptionKey cmdlet enables you to specify a destination file for the key and specify a password to protect the file.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Export-NAVEncryptionKey -ServerInstance DynamicsNAV -KeyPath "C:\Keys\nav.key" -Password (Get-Credential).Password
```

Description

-----------

The following example creates an encryption key in a password protected file.
