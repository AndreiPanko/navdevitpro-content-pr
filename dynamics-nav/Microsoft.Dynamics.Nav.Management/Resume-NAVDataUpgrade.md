# Resume-NAVDataUpgrade

## SYNOPSIS
Resumes a suspended data upgrade process.

## SYNTAX

### AllMethods (Default)
```
Resume-NAVDataUpgrade [[-Tenant] <TenantId>] [-ServerInstance] <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
```

### SingleMethod
```
Resume-NAVDataUpgrade [[-Tenant] <TenantId>] [-CodeunitId] <Int32> [-FunctionName] <String>
 [[-CompanyName] <String>] [-ServerInstance] <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can choose to re-run all previously failed and cancelled upgrade functions or choose a specific upgrade function. Only failed or cancelled upgrade functions can be re-run.

To get a list of invoked functions, use the Get-NAVDataUpgrade cmdlet. It is not possible to resume the data upgrade process if it was stopped by the Stop-NAVDataUpgrade cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Resume-NAVDataUpgrade -ServerInstance DynamicsNAV
```

This example resumes a currently suspended data upgrade process.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
Resume-NAVDataUpgrade -ServerInstance DynamicsNAV -CodeunitId 111111 -FunctionName Upg1 -CompanyName
```

This example resumes currently suspended data upgrade process by invoking a specific upgrade function that previously failed or was cancelled.
This approach can be useful for gradually fixing and rerunning upgrade functions without having to restore the full database and start from beginning.
