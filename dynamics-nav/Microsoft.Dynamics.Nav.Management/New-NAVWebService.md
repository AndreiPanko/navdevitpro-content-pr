# New-NAVWebService

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new Microsoft Dynamics NAV web service.

## SYNTAX

```
New-NAVWebService -ObjectType <ObjectType> -ObjectId <Int32> -ServiceName <String> [-Published <Boolean>]
 [-ServerInstance] <String> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Use the New-NAVWebService cmdlet to create and optionally publish web services that are based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV application objects. You can see which web services have already been created by running the Get-NAVWebService cmdlet.

In a multitenant deployment of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, web services are created in the application database, and they apply to all tenants that are mounted against that Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server instance.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
New-NAVWebService -ServerInstance DynamicsNAV -ServiceName Customer -ObjectType Page -ObjectId 21 -Published 1
```

This example uses the New-NAVWebService cmdlet to create and publish a web service that is based on page 21, Customer Card.
