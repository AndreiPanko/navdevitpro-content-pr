# Integrate a 3rd Party Solution
If you are an ISV with an existing 3rd party service offering, there are several reasons why you should choose to integrate to Dynamics 365 Business Central:

- Dynamics 365 Business Central exposes many “ready-to-use” APIs for Connect apps to make a seamless integration between your service offering and Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

- Bundle your services with a Dynamics 365 Business Central offering and give your customers an integrated experience that increases the value for their investment. 

- Use Microsoft AppSource to promote your service offering and reach more customers together with Dynamics 365 Business Central. 
Leverage the active community around Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

To obtain these goals, there are several different paths you can take: 
- Build a Connect app in your preferred coding language, using the exposed APIs from Dynamics 365 Business Central. Read more [here]().<!--connect-->
- Build an Add-on app, which enriches the Dynamics 365 Business Central experience. This type of app integrates into the user experience of Dynamics 365 Business Central and allows you to build an interface based on how you want your data to flow between Dynamics 365 Business Central and your service offering.
