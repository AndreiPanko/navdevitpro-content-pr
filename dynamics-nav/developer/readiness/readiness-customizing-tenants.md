# Customizing Tenants
Every business is unique. Harness the power of Dynamics 365 Business Central to match how you work: your streamlined processes, your terminology, and how your employees or departments connect and collaborate. 
While there may already be Add-on apps available on AppSource that cover a customer’s need, we’ve also got the tools for you to build fully custom functionality or adapt what is already in the box. 
 
## Examples of custom changes to Dynamics 365 Business Central 
- Capture structured information about the products you sell, such as serial number or expiry date. 
- Connect to other in-house data repositories or legacy systems to reduce duplicate data entry, such as synchronizing with your home-grown payroll software. 
- Hide data fields that are rarely or never used. 
- Add a printable report covering legally required declarations for your industry. 
- Automate repetitive processes such as as digital signing and emailing of documents related to service orders. 
- Create a role-specific dashboard and set of tasks for a unique role in your organization, such as mobile purchasing managers, or recruiting specialists. 
- Etc. 
 
## How do I customize? 
For most simple changes, the browser-based Designer allows you to rapidly adjust the UI without needing to write any code. Hide columns you do not need, drag-and-drop to reposition fact boxes, or show data fields that were previously hidden: these are all examples of simple changes you can roll out to your entire organization using Designer. 

With Visual Studio Code and Extensions v2.0, you are able to customize existing pages and tables by creating page and table extensions, or you can add new tables and pages to make entirely new functionality. You can even write business logic in AL. 

You can start customizing either in Designer or in Visual Studio Code. If you start in Designer, the AL source code generated by Designer is downloadable, so you can continue developing in Visual Studio Code if needed. If you start developing in Visual Studio Code, you will initiate Designer directly from Visual Studio Code, to customize using Designer. When done using Designer, you synchronize changes back to Visual Studio code keeping all changes reflected in the AL source code. The resulting AL code is compiled into a .app file, which can be deployed to production tenants. 

## How do I test my custom changes? 
To ensure business continuity and protect the integrity of live customer data, you cannot customize Dynamics 365 Business Central for an organization running in production. Instead, custom changes are tested on hosted sandbox environments or in containers. Changes can be tested thoroughly in the browser until they are deemed fit to deploy into production where they are applied as an Extension v2.0 and can immediately be used by everyone in the organization.
