# Integrate a 3rd Party Solution/Service (Connect Services and Interchange Data)

## What is a Connect app? 
A Connect app describes the scenario of establishing a point-to-point connection between Dynamics 365 Business Central and a 3rd party solution or service.   

## How do I create a Connect app?
A Connect app is typically created using standard REST API to interchange data. Any coding language capable of calling REST APIs can be used to develop your Connect app.  
Dynamics 365 Business Central exposes 44 standard APIs at the time of writing. More will be added over time. We strongly encourage using the standard API’s when possible. In cases where more interoperability is needed additional custom APIs can be created by utilizing Extensions v2.0 and the modern development tools.

## How can I benefit from offering a Connect app? 
Online service offerings like payroll, expense management, web-shops, project planning etc. typically have many connection points. Connect apps allow you to make connections between those online service offerings and your business solution. This connection can be achieved on a data level without any development. Therefore, reusing those connection points provides you with an opportunity to reuse your investments from REST integrations with other Cloud Services. 

Optionally, you can build an interface in Dynamics 365 Business Central, which determines how your data flows between Dynamics 365 Business Central and your online service offering. In this case we advise you to follow the guidance specified in the [Add-on section]().

## Examples of Connect apps 
Below you can find some examples of online services, which could benefit from being integrated to Dynamics 365 Business Central using Connect apps: 

- Payroll
    - Read the chart of accounts.
    - Synchronize employee information.
    - Push payroll transactions to the Dynamics 365 Business Central ledger.
- Bank integration
    - Make payments from within your business solutions to your bank. 
- Expenses
    - Collect and reconcile transactions in well-adopted expense apps. 
- Web-shops
    - Synchronize items, customers, and other entities to create sales orders and invoices. 
- Financial Services
    - Read financial data and provide value added services such as funding and loans. 

## How do I develop a Connect App?
Dynamics 365 Business Central offers many APIs that you can call from within your preferred coding language. 

Prior to publishing your app you can try out and develop against the APIs using a trial tenant: 

1. Sign up for [Dynamics 365 Business Central](). 
2. When exploring and prototyping the APIs, the easiest is to use basic authentication with the tenant specific endpoint https://api.financials.dynamics.com/v1.0/<tenant user domain url>/api/beta. 
    - To set up basic authentication, create a Web Service Access key in Dynamics 365. Log into your tenant, search for and open the Users page, and in the Web Service Access Key field, generate a key. Copy this, and use as the password for the username. 
    - For developing and production, you must, however, use Azure Active Directory (AAD)/OAuth v2 authentication and the common endpoint https://api.financials.dynamics.com/v1.0/api/beta. 
3. Go to the documentation on the APIs, you can get our published preview [here](). 
4. Download an API explorer, such as Postman or Fiddler to connect to and explore the API. See examples in below video.

You can now develop the integration using your favorite development tool. 

## How do I get my Connect app published in AppSource?  
To ease your journey, from the initial idea submission to the final publication, we have created a guide that you can lean on throughout the process of bringing your Connect app to Microsoft AppSource. The guide consists of a set of documents outlining the steps to take to get your app go live on the platform. You must complete the following steps in the given order to pass the different validation stages and get your app published on AppSource:

- If your Connect app requires a specific setup in Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can add objects by following the guide on developing Add-on apps in combination with using the Connect API. Find the guide on how to develop Add-on apps [here](readiness-add-on-apps.md).
