# Development of a Localization
If you want to bring capabilities of the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] Core to your local market, then there are several reasons why you would want to choose [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]: 

- Easy to translate and strong base capabilities ready for localization.
- Reach more customers by selling your app on Microsoft AppSource.
- [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] provides a proven ERP platform and application for your Add-on apps. 
 
As an app builder, your paths forward can be:

- Build an **Add-on app**, which enriches the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] experience. This type of app, which integrates into user experience of [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)], allows you to build an interface based on how you want your data to flow between [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] and your service offering.
