# Development of a Horizontal Capability
If you want to enhance the capabilities of the Dynamics 365 Business Central core capability and its experience, then you take the following paths: 

- Build an Add-on app, which enriches the Dynamics 365 Business Central experience. This type of app, which integrates into user experience of Dynamics 365 Business Central, allows you to build an interface based on how you want your data to flow between Dynamics 365 Business Central and your service offering.
