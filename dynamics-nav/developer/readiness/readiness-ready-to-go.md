# Ready to Go
## What does the **Ready to Go** program offering entail  
To support you in bringing your offerings (that being either services or apps) to Dynamics 365 Business Central and Microsoft AppSource, we have created a program called **Ready to Go**, which offers you different types of support material that you can mix and match as you see fit.  

The **Ready to Go** program has three different types of offerings:  
- You can service yourself by using the **Ready to Go** Documentation and Online Training Catalog. 
- You can be guided by ISV Development Centers and Master ISVs by using the **Ready to Go** Trainings and Workshops. 
- You can find the latest bits by using the **Ready to Go** platform (also called Microsoft Collaborate). 
 
## The "Ready to Go" documentation and Online Training Catalog 
To help you bring your app to AppSource we have made different materials available for you to use. In the **Ready to Go** documentation you can find information on both, which offerings you can provide, descriptions of the different opportunities that you can choose from, both technical and business for resellers and app developers. The **Ready to Go** documentation also offers guidance on how to publish your apps.

Before you drill into detailed learning material, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with this documentation first. You can find the **Ready to Go** documentation here: [http://aka.ms/BusinessCentralApps](http://aka.ms/BusinessCentralApps).  
 
The **Ready to Go** Online Training Catalog provides an extensive set of learning materials, both technical and business related, which is directed to respectivly App builders and resellers.     
You can find the **Ready to Go Online Training Catalog** here: [http://aka.ms/ReadyToGoOnlineLearning](http://aka.ms/ReadyToGoOnlineLearning).  
  
## Ready to Go training and workshops provided by ISV Development Centers and Master VARs 
The Microsoft ISV Development Centers (Dev Centers) provide technical service and have industry-specific knowledge that you can contract and leverage when developing your app. These companies are independently owned and operated, however, Microsoft focuses continuously on giving them expert level training, so that they always are up to date and ready to support respectively new technologies and new versions of Dynamics 365. 

Our Development Centers have strong ties with Microsoft’s R&D teams, as well as are an incremental part of our early engagement programs. For the very same reason they have built up a strong knowledge base and a set of highly developed best practices that you, as a partner, can lean on when developing your apps 

When contracting an ISV Development Center you get solid and well-founded assistance in creating offerings for Dynamics 365 Business Central and Microsoft AppSource.  

Microsoft’s ISV Development Centers have worldwide presence, and are therefore always within reach, and ready to assist you.

Microsoft has worked together with ISV Dev Centers and Master VARs to build out **Ready to Go Validation Workshops** to guide you in bringing your offering into Appsource. Go to their websites to find out more.<!-- link? -->
