# Development of a Vertical Solution
If you want to create an industry-specific solution, there are several reasons why you would want to choose Dynamics 365 Business Central:

- Dynamics 365 Business Central provides a proven ERP platform and application for your vertical solution. 
- Dynamics 365 Business Central is available in the cloud and to users across various multiple types of devices, which is always up-to-date. 

To bring your solution to the cloud with Dynamics 365 Business Central, there are different considerations you must make: 

- You can choose to extend and customize the existing Dynamics 365 Business Central application and enrich the end-user experience with your industry-specific functionality using the new and modern development tools and Extensions v2.0, which are made available with Dynamics 365 Business Central. Read more [here](readiness-add-on-apps.md).
- If you have an existing vertical ISV solution built on Microsoft Dynamics NAV and if that solution has already gained considerable traction in the market, then you will have the option to either:   
   - Refactor the solution to Extensions v2.0 using the modern development experience for Dynamics 365 Business Central. 
   - Or, *lift, then shift* the existing solution onto Dynamics 365 Business Central. Where the *lift* part enables to you take your existing code and move it to the cloud with minimal modifications and the *shift* part related to the modernization of the application over time using the new and improved modern development tools.
