# Add-On Apps

## What is an Add-on app? 
An Add-on app extends the existing functionality of Dynamics 365 Business Central to handle additional business processes, which can cover both vertical and horizontal needs. Add-on apps can be used in multiple scenarios, whether it is to integrate to online services, adding business functionality or extending the user interface.  
Add-on apps are developed using Visual Studio Code. These apps, in the format of Extensions 2.0, can be published through Microsoft AppSource, as configurable pre-built apps that can be applied on individual customer environments in Dynamics 365 Business Central.
