# Image Property
Specifies the icon that you want to associate with an action or an activity button. You can only choose from the icons that are available in the **Image List** window when you choose the **AssistEdit** button for the property. There are different icons that you can use on actions in the ribbon and activity buttons. If you want to view the different icons, see [Action Icon Library](../dynamics-nav/Action-Icon-Library.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The image property is not valid on page link actions that are set up under activity buttons in the navigation pane. These actions use a default image that cannot be changed.
