# Deprecated Features in the Spanish Version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Spain that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Multiple Interest Rates
The **G/L Account Equivalency** tool that was used for one-time conversion of an existing chart of accounts to a new one has been removed.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The Multiple Interest Rates feature is no longer specific to Spain, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. |
