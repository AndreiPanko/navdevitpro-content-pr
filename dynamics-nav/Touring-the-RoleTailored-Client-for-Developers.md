# Touring the RoleTailored Client for Developers
This section provides a visual overview of the generic RoleTailored client design, the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../dynamics-nav/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], including a description of the different windows, pages, parts, and general terminology.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The term RoleTailored client, which in [!INCLUDE[nav2009](../dynamics-nav/includes/nav2009_md.md)] referred only to the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../dynamics-nav/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], now can designate either of the Microsoft Dynamics NAV clients.
