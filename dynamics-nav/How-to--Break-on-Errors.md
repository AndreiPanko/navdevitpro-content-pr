# How to: Break on Errors
You can specify if the debugger breaks on the next error. If the debugger is set to break on errors, then it breaks execution both on errors that are handled in code and on unhandled errors. By default, the debugger is set to break on errors.  
  
 When the debugger breaks on an error, you can inspect variables and parameters. You can also review the error message in the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Show** group, by choosing **Last Error**.  
  
 For more information about how to open the **Debugger** window, see [Activating the Debugger](Activating-the-Debugger.md).  
  
### To break on errors  
  
1.  Activate the debugger. For more information, see [How to: Activate the Debugger from the Development Environment](../Topic/How%20to:%20Activate%20the%20Debugger%20from%20the%20Development%20Environment.md) or [How to: Activate the Debugger at the Command Prompt](../Topic/How%20to:%20Activate%20the%20Debugger%20at%20the%20Command%20Prompt.md).  
  
2.  In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Break Rules**.  
  
3.  In the **Debugger Break Rules** window, select the **Break On Error** check box, and then choose the **OK** button.
