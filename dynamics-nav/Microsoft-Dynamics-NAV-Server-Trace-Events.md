# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Trace Events
This topic describes the trace events that are generated by [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] server.  
  
 The following list provides useful information about event tracing.  
  
-   The event trace provider is **Microsoft\-DynamicsNAV\-Server**. You typically need to provide this name in the monitoring tool that you are using.  
  
-   There are four types of trace events: Windows event log, SQL traces, service calls, and C\/AL function calls. Trace event types are identified by a keyword with a corresponding decimal and hexadecimal value. The keywords and values enable you to collect data on specific trace events. Some tools support the hexadecimal values only and other tools support both hexadecimal and decimal.  
  
-   For most trace events, there is separate event for when an operation starts and when it stops. This enables you to determine the duration of the operation. Some monitoring tools, such as PerfView, will automatically return the duration in the stop event.  
  
-   Some monitoring tools might interpret and display the collected event trace differently than others. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
## Windows Event Log Trace Events  
 Windows Event Log trace events track errors, warnings, and information messages that provide information about the condition or state of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances. These events are also logged in the Windows Application event log of the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. For a complete list of the events, see [Monitoring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Events in the Windows Event Log](Monitoring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events-in-the-Windows-Event-Log.md).  
  
|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|EventViewer|1|0x1|  
  
## SQL Trace Events  
 SQL trace events track a specific set of SQL statements that are executed from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance against the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database on SQL Server.  
  
|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|SQLTracing|2|0x2|  
  
 The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, and the SQL statement. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
 The following table lists the SQL trace events.

## Service Call Trace Events  
 Service call trace events track when [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients run the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects: Queries, Reports, and XMLports.  
  
|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|ServiceCall|4|0x4|  
  
 The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, and the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] object ID. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
 The following table lists the service call trace events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task\/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|300|RunQuery\/Start|[!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Query objects that are opened and closed.|

|501|CloseSession|[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]s and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]s establish a connection to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
  
## C\/AL Function Trace Events  
 C\/AL function tracing events track the execution of C\/AL functions and statements on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.  
  
|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|ALTracing|8|0x8|  
  
 The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, C\/ALC\/AL function, C\/AL statements, and line number. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is not configured for full C\/AL function tracing, then only root\-level C\/AL function will be traced. Statements and C\/AL functions that are called from functions will not be traced. By default, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is not configured for full C\/AL functionf tracing. For information about how to specify full C\/AL function tracing, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).  
  
 The following table lists the C\/AL function tracing events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task\/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|400|ExecuteALFunction\/Start|C\/AL functions that are called.|  
|401|ExecuteALFunction\/Stop|C\/AL functions that are called.|  
|402|ExecuteALFunctionFailed|Errors that occur when executing C\/AL functions. The errors can be caused by exceptions or [ERROR Function \(Dialog\)](ERROR-Function--Dialog-.md) calls.|  
|403|ExecuteALFunction|C\/AL statements that are executed.<br /><br /> **Important:** This trace event is only traced when the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is configured to full C\/AL function tracing.|  
  
##  <a name="ArgRef"></a> Event Trace Data
