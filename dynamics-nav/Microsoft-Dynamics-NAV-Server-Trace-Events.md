# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Trace Events
This article provides an overview of the trace events that are generated by [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] server instance.

## Overview
-  There are two event trace providers that publish different trace events to the event log: Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server and Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Common. The trace events in this article are grouped according to their event trace provider. You typically need to provide this name in the monitoring tool that you are using.  
  
-   There are several types of trace events for each event trace provider, including: Windows event viewer, SQL traces, service calls, C/AL function calls, and telemetry. Trace event types are identified by a keyword with a corresponding decimal and hexadecimal value. The keywords and values enable you to collect data on specific trace events. Some tools support the hexadecimal values only and other tools support both hexadecimal and decimal.  
  
-   For some trace events, there is separate event for when an operation starts and when it stops. This enables you to determine the duration of the operation. Some monitoring tools, such as PerfView, will automatically return the duration in the stop event.  
  
-   Some monitoring tools might interpret and display the collected event trace differently than others. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  

## Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server Events
### Windows Event Viewer Trace Events  
Windows Event Viewer trace events track errors, warnings, and information messages that provide information about the condition or state of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances. These events can be viewed in the Dynamics NAV channel log and Application log of Event Viewer on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. For more information, see [Monitoring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Events in the Windows Event Log](Monitoring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events-in-the-Windows-Event-Log.md).

Statements and C/AL functions that are called from functions will not be traced. By default, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is not configured for full C/AL functionf tracing. For information about how to specify full C/AL function tracing, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).
