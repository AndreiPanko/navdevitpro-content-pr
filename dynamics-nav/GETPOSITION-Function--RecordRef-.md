# GETPOSITION Function (RecordRef)
Gets a string that contains the primary key of the current record.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
String := RecordRef.GETPOSITION([UseNames])  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *RecordRef*  
 Type: RecordRef  
  
 The RecordRef that refers to the record for which you want to know the primary key.  
  
 *UseNames*  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 Indicates whether a reference to the field name or the field number should be returned.  
  
 If this parameter is **true** \(default\) or if it is empty, the returned string contains references to field names in the table with which the record is associated. If the parameter is **false**, the returned string contains references to field numbers in the table with which the record is associated.  
  
 This parameter is optional.  
  
## Property Value\/Return Value  
 Type: Text or code  
  
 The name or number of the field that contains the primary key.  
  
## Remarks  
 This function works just like the [GETPOSITION Function \(Record\)](GETPOSITION-Function--Record-.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example opens the Customer table as a RecodRef that is named RecRef. The RecordRef variable uses the GETPOSITION function to retrieve the position of the primary key. The *UseNames* parameter is set to **true** so the name of the field that contains the primary key is returned. If you set *UseNames* to **false**, the number of the field is returned. This example requires that you create the following variables in the **C\/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|RecRef|RecordRef|  
|varPrimaryKey|Text|  
  
|Text constant|ENU value|  
|-------------------|---------------|  
|Text000|The primary key is: %1.|  
  
```  
  
RecRef.OPEN(DATABASE::Customer);  
varPrimaryKey := RecRef.GETPOSITION(TRUE);  
MESSAGE(Text000, varPrimaryKey);  
```
