# Configuring Dynamics NAV Web Client by Modifying the navsettings.json File
To install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], you run [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup. Setup installs a website with a web server instance for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] on an Internet Information Services \(IIS\) server and configures the connection from the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. After the installation, you can use [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] to add additional web server instances for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. The connection information is saved in the web.config file of the web server instance. After installation, you can change the configuration by modifying the web.config file.

## About the navsettings.json file  
The [!INCLUDE[web_server_settings_file_md.md](includes/web_server_settings_file_md.md)] is a Java Script Object Notification fitle type that is similar to files that use the XML file format. You can modify this file using any text or code editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.  

## Locating the web.config file  
You can have multiple [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] web server instances on IIS. Each instance has its own web.config file that is stored in the physical path of the application's virtual directory. The path is *%systemroot%\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\\[VirtualDirectoryName\]*. For example, the folder for the default [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] instance is %systemroot%\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)] folder.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  After you modify the web.config file, if you have [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] open in the Internet browser, the changes will not take effect until you close the browser session, and then reopen [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  

## Settings in the navsettings.json file  
The following table describes the settings that are available in the [!INCLUDE[web_server_settings_file_md.md](includes/web_server_settings_file_md.md)].  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  All values must be enclosed in quotation marks.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  In the [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] Web client, you no longer have to edit the Web.config file for the Company, Time Zone, Region, and Language settings. These settings have been removed from the Web.config file. Instead, you use the **My Settings** page found in the upper right corner under your sign in name. Using an old link with a specific company will overwrite the choice in **My Settings**.  

|Setting|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|AllowNtlm|Specifies whether NT LAN Manager \(NTLM\) fallback is permitted for authentication.<br /><br /> To require Kerberos authentication, set this value to **false**.<br /><br /> Values: **true**, **false**<br /><br /> Default value: **true**|  
|ClientServicesChunkSize|Sets the maximum size, in kilobytes, of a data chunk that is transmitted between [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. Data that is transmitted between [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is broken down into smaller units called chunks, and then reassembled when it reaches its destination.<br /><br /> Values: From 4 to 80.<br /><br /> Default value: 28|  
|ClientServicesCompressionThreshold|Sets the threshold in memory consumption at which [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] starts compressing data sets. This limits amount of consumed memory. The value is in kilobytes.<br /><br /> Default value: 64|  
|ClientServicesProtectionLevel|Specifies the security services used to protect the data stream between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This value must match the value that is specified in the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] configuration file. For more information, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).<br /><br /> Values: EncryptAndSign, Sign, None<br /><br /> Default value: EncryptAndSign|  
|Server|Specifies the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br /><br /> Default value: localhost|  
|ServerInstance|Specifies the name of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] connects to.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Managing Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Instances](Managing-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Instances.md).<br /><br /> Default value: [!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)]|  
|ClientServicesCredentialType|Specifies the authorization mechanism that is used to authenticate users who try to connect to the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md) and [Users and Credential Types](Users-and-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> The credential type must match the credential type configured for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] connects to. For information about how to set up the credential type on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).<br /><br /> Values: Windows, UserName, NavUserPassword, AccessControlService<br /><br /> Default value: Windows|  
|ClientServicesPort|Specifies the TCP port for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This is part of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]â€™s URL.<br /><br /> Values: 1-65535<br /><br /> Default value: 7046|  
|ServicePrincipalNameRequired|If this parameter is set to **true**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] can only connect to a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that has been associated with a service principal name \(SPN\).<br /><br /> If this parameter is set to **false**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] attempts to connect to the configured [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] service, regardless of whether that service is associated with an SPN.<br /><br /> For more information about SPNs, see [How to: Configure Delegation for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Configure-Delegation-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md).<br /><br /> Default: **false**|  
|SessionTimeout|Specifies the maximum time that a connection between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] can remain idle before the session is stopped.<br /><br /> In the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], this setting determines how long an open [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] page or report can remain inactive before it closes. For example, when the SessionTimeout is set to 20 minutes, if a user does not take any action on a page within 20 minutes, then the page closes and it is replaced with the following message: **The page has expired and the content cannot be displayed.**<br /><br /> The time span has the format \[dd.\]hh:mm:ss\[.ff\]:<br /><br /> -   dd is the number of days<br />-   hh is the number of hours<br />-   mm is the number of minutes<br />-   ss is the number of seconds<br />-   ff  is fractions of a second<br /><br /> Default value: 00:20:00|  
|ShowPageSearch|Specifies whether to show the **Search for Page or Report** icon in the ribbon pane of the Role Center. The **Search for Page or Report** lets users find [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects, such as pages, reports, and codeunits. **Note:**  The **Search for Page or Report** option only finds objects that are available from the Departments page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. <br /><br /> If you do not want to the **Search for Page or Report** icon available in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then set the parameter to **false**.<br /><br /> Default value: **true**|  
|UnknownSpnHint|Specifies whether to use a server principal name when establishing the connection between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] server and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This setting is used to authenticate the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], and it prevents the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] server from restarting when it connects to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] for the first time. You set values that are based on the value of the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key.<br /><br /> Value: The value has the following format.<br /><br /> \(net.tcp://NavServer:Port/ServerInstance/Service\)=NoSpn&#124;SPN<br /><br /> -   NavServer is the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br />-   Port is the port number on which the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is running.<br />-   ServerInstance is the name of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br />-   NoSpn&#124;SPN specifies whether to use an SPN. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to **false**, then set this value to NoSpn. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to **true**, then set this value to Spn.<br /><br /> Default value: \(net.tcp://localhost:7046/[!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)]/Service\)=NoSpn<br /><br /> If you set this key to the incorrect value, then during startup, the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] will automatically determine a correct value. This will cause the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to restart. **Note:**  For most installations, you do not have to change this value. Unlike the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], this setting is not updated automatically. If you want to change the default value, then you must change it manually.|  
|DnsIdentity|Specifies the subject name or common name of the service certificate for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br /><br /> This parameter is only relevant when the ClientServicesCredentialType is set to UserName, NavUserPassword, or AccessControlService, which requires that security certificates are used on the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] to protect communication. **Note:**  You can find the subject name by opening the certificate in the Certificates snap-in for Microsoft Management Console \(MMC\) on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. <br /><br /> For more information, see [How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md).<br /><br /> Value: The subject name of the certificate.<br /><br /> Default value: none|   
|SigninHelpLink|Specifies the URL to open if the user selects help on the sign in dialog.<br /><br /> Default value: none|  
|MediaResourceCacheSize|Specifies the default storage size assigned to images of 512 Mb. Once the maximum storage size is reached, a cleanup of the cache is initiated. The setting applies to all tenants on the specific [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. This means that all tenants share the assigned storage value for images.<br /><br /> Default value: 512 Mb|  
|HelpServer|Specifies the name of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] must connect to, such as *MyServer*.<br /><br /> Default value: none|  
|HelpServerPort|Specifies the TCP port on the specified [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] can access Help through, such as **49000**.<br /><br /> Default value: none|
